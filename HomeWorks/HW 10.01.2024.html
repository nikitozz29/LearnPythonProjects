<h3 class="title">ACT 1</h3>
<br>
<h3 class="title">PROLOGUE</h3>
<br>
<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
<p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
<p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
<p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
<p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
<p>Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows</p>
<p>Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
<p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
<p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
<p>Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,</p>
<p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
<p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
<p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

<br>
<p>Gregory, o' my world, we'll not carry coals.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="title">GREGORY</h3>
<br>
<p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
