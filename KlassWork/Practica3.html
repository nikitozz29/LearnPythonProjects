<h2 class="titles">Linear equation</h2>

A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form

  <p class="pFormula"><span   class="sFormula">&ensp; ax + b = 0 &ensp;</span></p>  

where <span class="letters">a</span> and <span class="letters">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="letters">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="letters">x</span> there.

<h2 class="titles">Quadratic Equation</h2>

The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

<p class="pFormula"><span   class="sFormula">&ensp;ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0&ensp;</span></p>  

where <span class="letters">a</span>, <span class="letters">b</span>, <span class="letters">c</span> are known values and <span class="letters">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="letters">a</span> can't be 0.

<h2 class="titles">The area of a circle (A)</h2>

<span class="letters">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="letters">r</span>) squared:

<p class="pFormula"><span   class="sFormula">&ensp;A = &pi; 	&#215; r<sup>2</sup> &ensp;</span></p> 

or, when you know the diameter (<span class="letters">D</span>):
<p class="pFormula"><span   class="sFormula">&ensp;A = (&pi; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup> &ensp;</span></p>  

or, when you know the circumference (<span class="letters">C</span>):
<p class="pFormula"><span   class="sFormula">&ensp;A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &pi; &ensp;</span></p>

<h2 class="titles">Intersection</h2>

The intersection of two sets <span class="letters">A</span> and <span class="letters">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,

<p class="pFormula"><span   class="sFormula">&ensp;A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }&ensp;</span></p>   

That is, <span class="letters">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="letters">x</span> is both an element of <span class="letters">A</span> and an element of <span class="letters">B</span>.
